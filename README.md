# Overview

This is my portfolio, it shows my projects and assignments I have worked on through my journey of being a web developer and gives detailed steps and technologies I used to solve these problems to create these applications. All of these projects and assignments were completed with detail and many hours of focus over a 24-week intensive program pinpointed on gaining technical programming skills in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, JQuery, Bootstrap, Firebase, Node.js, MySQL, MongoDB, Express, Handelbars.js & ReactJS.
